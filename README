CPDP_Project_2: A Messenger Application
**************

Author: Fatema Tabassum Liza

Contents:
This Messenger Application has been developed using C and C++ Language. 
There are 2 C++ Program Files along with some other necessary files.
Some of the significant files are: 
    messenger_server.cpp
    messenger_client.cpp
    user_info_file (store all the user informations)
    server_config (store the information for server configuration)
    client_config (store the information for client configuration)
    Makefile
    README (this file)
All these files are in the same directory.
*************

Execution:
To compile and get the executables run command: make all
Makefile:
1. The makefile compiles both the programs properly and produces executables files.
2. Use 'make all' to compile and execute.

Server Initialization: ./messenger_server user_info_file server_config
[User needs to update the port number in server_config file according to the execution environment]

Client Initialization: ./messenger_client client_config 5400
[The user needs provide a port number other than the one specified in the files which is a different port no for each client]
[The user has to update the values for servhost and servport in the client_config file according to the execution environment]

All the programs and files have been checked in linprog for execution.

Features:
The necessary features available in this program is described below:
    1. The server is run with addition two arguments - a configuaration file name [server_config] and a user information file name [user_info_file].
    2. After connecting to the server
        a. A new user can register using the 'r' command.
        b. An existing user can login from client using the 'l' command.
        c. Client can quit the program using the 'exit' command.
        d. A logged in user can logout from the server using the 'logout' command.
        e. Any user can login from the client after being logged out [can be the old user or another user]
        f. Using m friend_username message' command, a logged in users can send messages to his/her friends.
        g. A logged in user can invite another user (not currently in the user's friend list) to become friend and chat using the 'i potential_friend_username message' command.
        h. Using the 'ia inviter_username' command, an user can accept an invitation from another user.
        i. The user has to login after registration since automatic login isn't enabled for newly registered user.

    3. Server side - I/O multiplexing : Done using select() function.
    4. Client side - I/O multiplexing : Done using POSIC() threads.
    5. Server and Client both programs can handle SIGINT signal. Opened connections are closed before exiting the program as well.
    6. Each time a client register is successful the information is written into the user_info_file.
    7. Each time Ctrl-C is pressed all the new information is written into user_info_file.
    8. The necessary socket connections are closed properly when a user issues the command 'logout'.
    9. STL containers (vectors, unordered_map, iterator etc) have been used as data structures on server and client side.
    10. All the messages for keep the communication consistent have been shown
    11. messages with spaces can also be passed

Limitations:
1. Did not used Qt for any GUI (Graphical User Interface).

Acknowledgement and References:

For implementing the program I've taken the basic ideas from the UNP and APUE books, the class
lecture slides and sample programs used in the class. I have read several online blogs aind github
code for implementing Sockets and Threads. I used stackoverflow whenever I was stuck in somewhere during the implementation.
